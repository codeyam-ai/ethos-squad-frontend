# Ethos Squad Frontend

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It uses Typescript and Tailwind CSS.

This repo is an example of how to use [EthosConnect](https://docs.ethoswallet.xyz/), a library that makes it easy to connect your dApp to the Sui blockchain and let your users connect their wallet.

**This is the completed code.** To clone the template starter repo that has not implemented EthosConnect, view [Ethos Squad Frontend Starter](https://github.com/EthosWallet/ethos-squad-frontend-starter).
